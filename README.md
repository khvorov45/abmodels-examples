# abmodels-examples

Example R code to demonstrate the application of statistical models to antibody data.

Each script generates an output stored in the same folder as the script. Some scripts need output generated by other scripts (e.g., data needs to be simulated before it is plotted).

Easiest way to generate everything is with [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#)

```shell
snakemake all --cores all
```
