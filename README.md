# Application of statistical models to antibody data

## Dependencies

Dependencies can be installed by running `dependencies.R`, e.g.

```shell
Rscript dependencies.R
```

from the project directory.

## Usage

Each script generates an output stored in the same folder as the script. Some scripts need output generated by other scripts (e.g., data needs to be simulated in `data/sim-cox.R` before it is plotted in `data-plot/plot-cox.R`).

Scripts have comment annotations saying which script generates the required file.

Easiest way to generate everything is with [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#)

```shell
snakemake all --cores all
```

Everything that's generated can be removed with

```shell
snakemake all --cores all --delete-all-output
```

[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) isn't required though, every file can be run manually (e.g., from [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)) as long as the files are run in the right order and all dependencies are installed.
